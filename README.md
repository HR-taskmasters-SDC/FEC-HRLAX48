**migoShop** is a showcase of front end capability utilizing React and various frameworks to build a retail site given a predetermined backend of data.

To compile the code, run `npm run build` and then open public/index.html in a browser.

As a quirk/restriction of the image uploading API (imgur), you can't use `localhost` to display the site if you want to upload images to answers or reviews. Please use `http://0.0.0.0` instead.

Tests can be run with `npm test` and you can get coverage with `npm run coverage`.
